# Exam

## Start your exam

- Clone this repository.
- Open the folder in PyCharm.
- If you get asked to create a virtual environment, click on OK.
- Before you start coding, open the .env file and fill in the necessary information to connect with your database on Neon. **Make sure to connect to your personal project on Neon, not your group project!**
- Download the SQL file singers.sql (available on Canvas), copy its content and execute it in the SQL editor of your database on Neon.
- Execute the command `uvicorn main:app --reload`.

## Upload exam to Canvas (when your exam is finished!)

- Create a ZIP file from the Python project and rename this ZIP file to API_class_lastName_firstName.zip, so for example API_1ITF01_Doe_John.zip
- Upload the file API_1ITF01_Doe_John.zip to Canvas (at the right question)

## IMPORTANT: READ THIS BEFORE YOU START YOUR EXAM!

- If you can't copy sourcecode from Chrome, use Firefox or Edge instead (Proctorio sometimes blocks copy/paste in Chrome)
- You're not allowed to use any form of AI (Artificial Intelligence) to solve the exam
- All activities are monitored and recorded with Proctorio and AI cheating detection (cheating is exam fraud!)
- Do not wait until the last few minutes to create the ZIP file because there is a chance that you will not be able to upload your exam on time!
